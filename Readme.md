# First Repository

This is my very first repository with the Kekambas-142 Cohort!

### Git Commands
1. `git init` to create a new repository
2. `git add <filename>` or `git add .` to add files to staged changes
3. `git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"` to commit (or take a snapshot)
4. `git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>` to add remote connection to GiHub
    - `<https://github.com/Leoncarson3/CarsonBeta/compare/Leoncarson3-patch-1>` will usually be `origin`
    - `<rhttps://github.com/Leoncarson3/CarsonBeta/pull/1/commits/4fb550a0fc4a24278c254a3e23ecd64c1e4a0051>` is the URL to GitHub Repository
5. `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>` to send commits to GitHub
    - `<remote_name>` will usually be `origin`
    - `<branch_name>` will usually be `main`
    - You can add `-u` flag to command to set up tracking
